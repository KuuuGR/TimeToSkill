# TimeToSkill

**Track your time. Learn smarter. Grow with patience.**

TimeToSkill is a minimalistic app that helps you monitor your learning progress and achieve meaningful growth through time investment.

🕒 Want to master a skill? Start with 20 hours. Then reach 100, 1,000... or even 10,000.  
📈 Inspired by learning theories, TimeToSkill lets you track how far you’ve come — and motivates you to keep going.  
🌍 Available in 40 languages, with global wisdom and motivational quotes from around the world.
